# The legendary flappy bird game 

This is my implementation of the legendary flappy bird game, which gained massive popularity between 2013 and 2015. Just like the original game, my implementation is meant to be hard. [Flappy bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird)


## Features

- Built entirely with Haskell, showcasing functional programming techniques
- Utilizes Gloss library for simple and effective graphical representations and animations
- Offers basic interface for player interaction


## Prerequisites

Make sure you have GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) and Stack installed on your machine. This project was build with GHC version 9.4.8 and Stack version 2.15.1

For installation, follow to this link: [Link](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/)


## Running

1. Clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/williamlempinen/haskell-flappy-bird.git`

`cd haskell-flappy-bird`

2. Build the project

`stack build`

3. Run the game

`stack run`


## How to play

After running the command `stack run`, new pop-up window will appear. You can close this at anytime by pressing the ESC-key. This is also equivalent to killing the program.

From the initial menu window you have to press Enter to switch to the playing stage, where space-bar clicks equals to jumping. 

After losing you have to press Enter once to enter the menu stage, and twice to play again.

Try to beat my record, which is 16. 
Good luck!!
